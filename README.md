## Cantor's Diagonal Argument

**Central Idea:** What has more numbers? The set of rational numbers between \(0\) and \(1\), or the number of natural numbers beginning at 0?

Imagine we write out a list of every possible random number between 0 and 1, and each number would have its own special index. \
For example: \
1| 0.0000000000....00 \
2 | 0.0000000000....01 \
3 | 0.0000000000....02

This means we would have an infinite collection of numbers with infinite indexes. \
But **does this set contain ALL possible numbers between 0 and 1**? \

It might appear (almost obviously) that because we have just defined the range to include all numbers between 0 and 1, they should be there.

We couldn't be FURTHER from the truth.
