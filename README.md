## Cantor's Diagonal Argument

`Central Idea` \
What has more numbers? The set of rational numbers between $`[0, 1]`$, or the number of natural numbers beginning at 0 and expanding to $`\infty`$?

Imagine we write out a list of every possible random number between 0 and 1, and each number would have its own special index. \
For example: \
$`1 \text{ } | \text{ } 0.0000000000....00`$ \
2 | 0.0000000000....01 \
3 | 0.0000000000....02

This means we would have an infinite collection of numbers with infinite indexes. \
But **does this set contain ALL possible numbers between 0 and 1**? \

There is no one-to-one correspondence between the numbers between 0 and
